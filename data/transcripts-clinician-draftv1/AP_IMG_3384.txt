I have just one more thing to ask you about. I'm asking people to tell me about a memory from their past, a childhood memory or from when they were young, that was like a bad memory, hopefully nothing too traumatic but do you have a memory of something that did happen
yeah, when I was
six years old,
there was a civil war in the domincan republic
and I remember
walking with my father
and my father was one of the targets
they they had selected
selected to eliminat
because he was part of 
the government that overthrew the communist government
that was elected
and uh so I remember the bullets flying over our heads
oh my goodness well that's a terrible memory, oh my goodness, but i know from our history that he lived until well until his 90s, so you made it, did that last for a long time
he was uh
from april to uh about november
because that the american troops intervened
to get everything in order,
until 1966
there was a regular election
but uh yeah, the american presence was visible

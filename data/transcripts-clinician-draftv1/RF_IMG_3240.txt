and came down to portland
and ate a lot of good lobster
and had fun 
Nice! Did you do excursions off the boat?

for that one we took 
a horse drawn carriage through
whos town I can't remember

pretty cool 
and we went and saw 
an old village 
where 
the people in the village
they all dressed up like 
they would've back when the village was founded

Yeah. I have fairly good, you know, no issues that I can really remember 
but I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank god it wasn't too high
Reaching for the next one and the next one and all of a sudden you don't get it and "pew bam" 
It wasn't horrible but it hurt 
No, I never had a broken bone
Thank god

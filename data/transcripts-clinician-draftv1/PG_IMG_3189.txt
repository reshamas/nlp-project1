I'm going to have you tell me about a nice vacation or a fun vacation you took at some time. It can be any time in your life. A trip 
One of out favorite things to do is go to Myrtle Beach 
In April 
April May 
every year 
and we visit friends 
and that sort of thing 
they come down with us sometimes 
i brought my kids down there 
whole family down there 
do you stay on the water 
yeah 
we have a timeshare 
okay so we use the timeshare 
we stay on the beach most of the time 
travel around and eat 
and the place has places
where you can have bbq grill and stuff like that 
they have it out there 
either propane or charcoal 
do pools and hot tubs everything like that 
I donâ€™t do that I don't like that stuff 
I mean I'll do the pool 
and the ocean's kind of cool 
other than that 
the kids have a ball 
they do the sandy beach and stuff like that 
thats a good time 
yeah its fun 
we stay the week 
do you get golfing?
not usually
not if the kids come 
because we have one vehicle 
oh i see 
I've been using the 
cooking man 
that my car 
while i'm working
when I'm done at the end of the year I really don't know yet 
it seems alrright to say it 
if you still want to come around or not 
cause hes paying me something obviously 
but Im still

thats why giving an attitude 
me justl ike my car 
or my home

I'm also going to ask you to tell me a story about a bad, hopefully not too traumatic, but like a bad childhood memory if you have any or adolescent something that happened that wasn't too great 
I remember when I was very young.
well not very
maybe about 10 years old 
my father worked in a summer camp
and a few of us kids 
were horsing around and we were climbing out of a window
and I sort of fell and hit my wrist and broke my wrist 
which made my the rest of the summer 
this was in the beginning of the summer 
not too much fun 
cause I had a cast on my wrist for like 
three-quarters of the summr 
oh my goodness did your dad, did you get in trouble for it or
yeah minor
minor trouble
yeah lets see 
thats okay , thats fine

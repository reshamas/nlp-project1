story about something
i know yes one more story. This one can be really interesting. I want you to tell me about a childhood or adolescent memory that wasn't, hopefully not too traumatic, but something that was a bad childhood memory
yeah, next door was this big tree 
and uhm, we kids thoguht it would be cool to cimb up in the tree
and and we had a board,
and I don't know if we made like a little sign or not
but pounded that board into that tree.
And so around the corner was a funeral home and the man 
and the the directore of the home was called van deusen
mr van deusen,
and so all us kids were were we had those
uhm this this board in the tree
and and and uhm and uhm so
so somebody said van deusen to get that board out of that tree
so i climbed up, yanked the thing down, threw it down, a
and I jumped out of the thing and right on the board with the nails up.
I'm walking around screaming,
and I'm walking with the board stuck in my my my sneaker, blood all over the place,
and i'm screaming bloody bloody murder
and my mom comes running out and stuff like that
nd i'm yelling "i hate you van deusen"
and I'm uhm i'm so
obviously we went to the doctor
and it was for like months
and it was hard to even walk,
just trying to recuperate from it
poor guy

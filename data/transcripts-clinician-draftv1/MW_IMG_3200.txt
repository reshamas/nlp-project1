alright 
hows it going today 
its novemeber 15 and Im goign to have you tell me about a trip that you have taken. It can be any time actuallt maybe just the trip that you just took in a little bit tell me about it 
well I uh 
got on the plane in 
syracuse 
I went 
Baltimore 
airport 
then we went to 
albuquerque
where i got off the plane 
and Gale Darby, my RN 
picked me up 
and we uh 
went 
her son's place
and thats where I stayed 
and 
Friday we sat or
Friday we did a few things 
and then Saturday we went to the 
Bloom Festival
and on a bus trip
which was the easierst and cheapest way of getting there 
because 
for 25 dollars we took the bus from the 
shopping mall 
and 
the 
price of getting in the bus ride was 25 dollars 
oh nice 
so it was really reasonable
and the bus dropped us right off 
the place we
entered the 
the bloom festival 
which was better than walking a half mile from the parking lot 
oh yeah forget that 
it also including the handicap which was a half mile lane too 
but 
we 
did that for several hours 
came back and rested 
we went up to santa fe 
it was 
Monday 
yea h monday 
we went up to santa wfe 
we went to 
checked out 
the oldest house in the United States
and the oldest church in the United States 
oh my goodness
we were going to eat out there but 
they also were having a 
festival at that day 
which the center where we wanted to eat 
was all filled out 
and there was no parking 
okay alright

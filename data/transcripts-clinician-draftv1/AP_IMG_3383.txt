it is 12.6.23, and I'm just gonna ask you to tell me a little bit about a trip of some sort that you've taken in the past that was enjoyable
I went to grand canyon, pennsylvania
just like the grand canyon,
but its
in a in a 
smaller scale 
and its its 
natural made, it wasn't made by man
we didn't go all the way down because I was too scared, 
we could see it from the top.
It is called the grand canyon pennsylvnia
i have never heard of that, i have to look it up, what part is it near
uh, that I don't remember, but I remember driving to it from portaloonie new york to the grand canyon pennsylvania
but I remember driving to it from Waterloo new york to the grand canyon pennsylvania
did you stay there for a few days or do some hiking
just for hiking yeah
how long does it take to hike it
as I said,
we didn't hike all the way down,
but uh, couple of hours I would say
oh that is so neat, did you do that recently?
no that was many years ago
yeah, okay
but its in my memory, yeah

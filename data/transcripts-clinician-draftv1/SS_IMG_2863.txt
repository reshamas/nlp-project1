Now One more thing I'm going to have you tell me is a childhood memory that wasn't good, that was sad, hopefully not too dramatic 
Yeah
I have fairly good, you know, 
no issues that I can really remeber 
but I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank god it wasnt too high
Reaching for the next one and the next one andall of a sudden you don't get it and "pew bam" 
It wasn't horrible but it hurt 
Did you break any thing?
No, I never had a broken bone
Thank god

Six years ago, we went to disney world 
It was my fourth thime being there

We were there for a week, whole week 
It was just wonderful, I mean things from Disney I remember from years ago, new things 
It was. It was great got a lot of pictures videos and
What do you think the highlihgt was? What was your favorite experience? 
At the Hollywood tower of terror

Have you been?
Hollywood tower of terror 
They put you on a ride and you and your in this big haunted mansion and you know you cant see a thing until you know whats coming up becuase you can see this tower this elevator tower open really high and then you hear people screaming AHH because it drops you to the bottom
Oh my gosh, that sounds terrifying

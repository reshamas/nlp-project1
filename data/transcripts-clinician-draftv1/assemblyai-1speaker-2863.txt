Yeah
I have fairly good, you know, 
no issues that I can really remeber 
but I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank god it wasnt too high
Reaching for the next one and the next one andall of a sudden you don't get it and "pew bam" 
It wasn't horrible but it hurt
No, I never had a broken bone
Thank god

Yeah, I had a pretty. Fairly good, you know, no issues that I can really remember. But I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank God it wasn't too high, you know, reaching for the next one and the next one, and then all of a sudden you're reaching and you don't get it, and you bam. It wasn't horrible, but it's scary.
No, I didn't. No. I've never had a broken bone.

 It is 11-21-23 and I'm going to have you tell me a little bit about a trip or vacation, some type of excursion you've had that you enjoyed in the past. Oh, okay. Our last cruise was up to Canada and we stopped at Halifax and Nova Scotia and came down to Portland and ate a lot of good lobster and had fun. Nice. What did you do? Did you go out and do excursions like off the boat or? Yes. Yeah. We took, on that one, we took a horse-drawn carriage through a town whose name I can't remember and that was pretty cool. We went and saw an old village where the people... In the village, they all dressed up like they would have back when the village was founded. Saw some pretty spectacular views in Canada. Nice. That sounds good. Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

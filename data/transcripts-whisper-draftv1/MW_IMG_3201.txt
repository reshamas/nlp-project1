 One more story I'll ask you to tell me is I'm asking people to tell me about something like a bad memory from your youth or from when you were younger hopefully nothing too traumatic but just something that you know when you were a little or a teenager. Hmm, I don't really remember. Oh there was a, I was climbing up a tree in a neighbor's yard and she caught me and not only did she chew me out but she hit me several times. Oh no. And I went home talked to my father about it he says well you shouldn't have been up in the tree and that's about all I can remember. Okay, that's fair.

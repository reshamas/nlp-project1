 And one more thing I'll ask you to tell me about is a childhood memory that wasn't good, like a sad or, you know, hopefully not too traumatic, but like a bad memory from childhood. Yeah. I had a pretty fairly good, you know, no issues that I can really remember, but I do remember falling out of a tree. Thank God it wasn't too high. You know, reaching for the next one and the next one, and then all of a sudden you're reaching and you don't get it, and you, bam. It wasn't horrible, but it hurt. Scary. It hurt, yeah. Did you break anything? No, I didn't. No, I've never had a broken bone. Good. Thank God. Okay.

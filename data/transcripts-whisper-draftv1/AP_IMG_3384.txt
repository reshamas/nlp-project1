 I have just one more thing to ask you about. I'm asking people to tell me about a memory from their past, like a childhood memory or when you were young that was like a bad memory. Hopefully nothing too, you know, too traumatic, but you have a memory of something that happened? Yeah, those are when I was six years old. There was a civil war in the Dominican Republic and I remember walking with my father and my father was one of the targets that they had selected to eliminate because he was part of the government that overthrew the communist government that was elected. So I remember the bullets flying over our heads. Oh my goodness. Well that's a terrible memory. Oh my goodness. Yes. But I know from our history that he lived until well into his 90s so that's scary. Did that last for a long time or was that brief? From April until about November because the American troops intervened to get everything in order. So, wow. Then in 1966, regular elections. Yeah. The American president was not certain, so that's bodyguards not certain. A mother wordt gaye. He's like this blonde baldy today thinking,class eco-ковretaria family. He had notice was visible. MS. Mm-hmm. Oh, my goodness, what a memory.

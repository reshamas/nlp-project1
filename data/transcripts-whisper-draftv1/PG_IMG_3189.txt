 All right, I'm going to have you tell me about a nice vacation or a fun vacation you took at some point. It can be any time in your life or trip. One of our favorite things to do is go down to Myrtle Beach in April, April, May, every year. We visit friends and that sort of thing. They come down with us sometimes. I brought my kids down there, the whole family down there, stuff like that. Do you stay on the water? Yeah. We have a timeshare. Oh. Okay, so we use the timeshare. We stay on the beach most of the time, travel around to eat, and the place has places where you can use a barbecue grill and stuff like that. They have it out there, either propane or charcoal. Mm-hmm. They have both. And pools and hot tubs and everything else. I don't do the hot tub. I don't like that stuff. Okay. But anyway. Nice. I do the pool and I'll go out, but the ocean's kind of cool. Mm-hmm. It's still cool. Other than that, kids have a ball because it's a sandy beach and stuff like that. It's fun. It's a good time. Yeah, it is fun. Nice. We usually stay a week. Do you get some golfing? Not usually. Not if kids come. Mm-hmm. We don't do that. Because we got one vehicle. Oh, I see. I've been using the company van. Mm-hmm. That's been my car while I'm working. But if I'm done at the end of the year, I really don't know yet to see what the owner has to say. So if he wants me to still come around or not. Mm-hmm. Because he's paying me something, obviously. But I'm still a director. Right. That's why he's hanging on to me just like my, I'll call it my co-partner. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Massachusetts. Let's see. Okay. When we get together and we actually.

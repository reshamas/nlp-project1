 I'm going to have you tell me a little bit about a trip that you've taken that you enjoyed. Six years ago, we went to Disney World. It was my fourth time being there. And I went with my daughter and her husband and my grandson, Nicholas, and it was wonderful. We were there for a week, a whole week. It was just wonderful. I mean, things from Disney that I remember from years ago, new things. It was great. Got a lot of pictures and videos. What do you think the highlight was? What was your favorite experience? The Hollywood Tower of Terror, I think they call it. Have you been? Hollywood Tower of Terror. They put you on a ride and you go and you're in this big haunted mansion and you can't see a thing really until you know what's coming up because you could see this tower, this elevator tower open really high and then you hear people screaming, because then it drops you to the bottom. Oh my God, it sounds terrible. No, it was wonderful. It was wonderful. It really was. It was wonderful. It was a very good experience. Okay. All right. Thank you.

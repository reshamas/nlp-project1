 to ask you about. I'm going to ask you to tell me a little bit about a childhood memory that wasn't great. Hopefully not too traumatic, but we all kind of remember something from childhood. I feel like a lot of us do that was like, oh. I think one memory that I can tell you about is that I was in the garage and I was doing something with my father, whatever, and the bench fell on my leg, over on my leg, and I broke my leg. Oh no. And I had to go to the hospital and get set and stuff like that. That was a long time ago. I don't even, I can't tell you the year either. That's one of the things I do remember most. Oh, poor kid. How old were you, do you know? I want to say 14-ish, 14, 15, something like that. Maybe 13, 14, 15, that age. Poor guy. But, I'm not sure. It hasn't bothered me all my life, really. I really haven't had an issue. Good, okay.

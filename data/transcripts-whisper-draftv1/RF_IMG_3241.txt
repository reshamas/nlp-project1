 I'm also going to ask you to tell me a story about a bad, hopefully not too traumatic, but like a bad childhood memory, if you have any, or adolescence, something that happened that wasn't great. Oh, I remember when I was very young, well, not very, maybe about 10 years old, my father worked in a summer camp and a few of us kids were horsing around and we were climbing out of a window and I sort of fell and hit my wrist and broke my wrist. Which made the rest of the summer, I was in the beginning of the summer, not too much fun because I had a cast on my wrist for like three quarters of the summer. Oh my goodness. Did your dad, did you get in trouble for it? Yeah, minor, minor trouble. Yikes, let's see. It's okay, that's fine. Alright.

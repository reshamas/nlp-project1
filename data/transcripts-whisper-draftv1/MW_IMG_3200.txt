 How's it going today? It's November 15th and I'm going to have you tell me a story about a trip that you've taken. It can be any time. Actually, maybe just the trip you just took a little bit. Tell me about it. Okay. Well, I got on the plane in Syracuse. I went to Baltimore Airport and then we went to Albuquerque where I got off the plane and Gail Dalby, my RN, picked me up and we went to her son's place and that's where I stayed. And... Friday we sat... Or Friday we did a few things and then Saturday we went to the Balloon Festival and on a bus trip, which was the easiest and really the cheapest way of getting here because for $25 you took the bus from a shopping mall. And the price of... $25? The price of getting in and the bus ride was $25. Oh, nice. So it was really reasonable and the bus dropped us right off at the place we entered the Balloon Festival, which was better than walking a half of a mile from the parking lot. Oh, yeah. Which also included the handicap, which was a half mile away, too. But we did that. We did that. We did that. We did that. We did that. We did that for several hours. Came back and rested. We went up to Santa Fe. It was Monday. Yeah. Monday we went to Santa Fe. And we went to... Checked out... We went to Santa Fe. We went to Santa Fe. We went to Santa Fe. We went to Santa Fe. We went to Santa Fe. S2 S3 S4 S5 S5 S7 S9 S10 S13

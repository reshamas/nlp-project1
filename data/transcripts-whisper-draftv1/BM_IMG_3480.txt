 It is 12-19-23 and I'm going to have you first tell me a little bit about a nice trip or vacation or something that you've taken in your past that you enjoyed. I don't go on a lot of vacations. Or even a trip like to Texas like your wife was saying if you visit family. Yeah, we go to visit my wife's sister and her husband and her family with lots of their grandchildren there and it's good for my wife. It's good for her to get back home. Two thousand miles away from home. Where we are now. It's good to be in touch with their family and get to do things and to hear their accents and to eat lots of food and just have a good time. Nice. What part of Texas is it? West Texas. Yeah. Hardly rains. Oh wow. One of the things about that place is when I take a walk I don't hardly sweat and that's unusual for me. Yeah. I can take a walk in the middle of town because it's just so dry. It's so dry. You listen to the news and the humidity today 20% you know or something like that and so it's a real dry place and they grow, my wife was a, my wife's father was a, their land had oil on it and also they had beef but it was beef cattle. It wasn't cattle. It wasn't beef. Okay. wasn't milk cattle, you know, because it was, there's just not enough water. Oh. Yeah, so you go to the store, and when you want to buy milk, it's a lot of money, because they have to ship it in, most of it, but there's a lot of, the beef is cheaper than around here. Okay.

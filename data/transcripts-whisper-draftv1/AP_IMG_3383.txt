 It is 12-6-23 and I'm just going to ask you to tell me a little bit about a trip of some sort that you've taken in the past that was enjoyable. Yeah, I went to Grand Canyon, Pennsylvania. It's just like the Grand Canyon, but it's in a smaller scale and it's natural made. It wasn't made by men and we didn't go all the way down because I was too scared. You could see it from the top and it's called the Grand Canyon, Pennsylvania. I have never heard of that. I have to look it up. What part is it near? That I don't remember, but I remember driving to it from Waterloo, New York to the Grand Canyon, Pennsylvania. Did you? Did you stay there for a few days or do some hiking? Just for hiking, yeah. Nice. How long does it take to hike it? As I said, we didn't hike all the way down, but a couple of hours, I would say, yeah. Oh, that is so neat. Yeah. Did you do that recently? No, that was many years ago. Yeah, okay. It stays in my memory, yeah.

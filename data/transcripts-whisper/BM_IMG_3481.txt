 story about something? I know, yes, one more story. This one is, can be really interesting. I want you to tell me about a childhood or adolescent memory that wasn't, hopefully not too traumatic, but something that was like a bad childhood memory. Yeah, next door was this big tree and we kids thought it would be cool to climb up in the tree and we had a board and I don't know if we made like a little sign on it or not, but we climbed, we skimmed it up the tree and pounded that board into that tree. And so around the corner was a funeral home and the man, the director of the home was called Van Dusen, Mr. Van Dusen. And so all us kids were, you know, we had those, we had those, this board in the tree and so um um um, so, so somebody said, Van Dusen said to get that bar, that board out of that tree, you know, so I climbed up, yanked the bar, yanked the thing down and threw it down and I jumped out of the thing and I ran on the board with the nails up and I'm walking around screaming and, and, and I'm walking with the board in my, walking with it stuck in my, my, my, my, my, my sneaker, you know, blood all over the place and I'm screaming bloody, bloody murder. My, my, my mom comes running out and stuff like that and, and I'm yelling out, I hate you Van Dusen. And, um, and, and so, you know, obviously we went to the doctor and, and just for like, I don't know, seemed like months, you know, it was hard to even walk, you know, just, you know, trying to re, re, recuperate from it. So that was, Poor guy.

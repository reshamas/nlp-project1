 We'll talk about one more thing and tell me a little bit about a childhood memory that wasn't good. Hopefully nothing too scary but something you remember from your youth that was a bad memory. When I was around eight or nine years old, I had problems with a kidney that I don't remember too good but all I remember is I was in a hospital when I was around nine years old and I was away from home for over a week which was upsetting. I remember the good part of that was all my aunts and uncles came to visit me in a hospital but I missed my brothers quite a bit and my parents. Hospitals were a lot different back then. It was sort of a colder feeling. I remember that. I was left there alone overnight in a child's ward and the only thing I remember is I talked to my brothers by phone a few times during the week I was there and it seemed so distant even though they were only not even a few blocks away really. It was called St. Luke's Hospital and we lived in East Utica. My dad worked so he only could come see me at night. My mom had to take care of my brothers so she would come see me when she can. I was alone in the hospital at a young age so it was not a memory that I'm fond of but I do remember. Things are different today. You can do things differently with a kid in a hospital. Somehow you make your work a little easier but back then it was hard. Juggling would work in and other children. I remember that. It was a long feeling to be there that long. That's one memory I have from my childhood.

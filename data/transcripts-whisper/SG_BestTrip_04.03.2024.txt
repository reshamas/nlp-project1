 So the date is April 2nd, 2024. And I would like you to tell me if you could about a trip that you've taken in the past. I took a trip to, a lot of trips to Pennsylvania. My son lives there. So we go there a lot. Gillsburg, right outside Harrisburg. We have taken trips to Disney. Tell me a little bit about that. It was enchanting. It was so much fun. The kids, he enjoyed watching the kids. They made it magical. The kids did. And if anybody, anyone, if they can ever get a chance to go, they should go. It is magical. What did you do there? We rode, of course, rides. We took, we took a, went to the Animal Kingdom and rode the safari, which that was fun. We went up and down on Main Street. Of course, we saw Mickey and Minnie and she and all them. We watched the parade. We went in the castle, saw Cinderella. Neat. Okay.

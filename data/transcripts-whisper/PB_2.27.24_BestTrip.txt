 All right, this is TB. It's 2-27-24. And I'm just going to ask you to tell me about a vacation or trip that you've taken. It could be recent or a long time ago. Anything you can recall. Yeah, we went to Disney World more than once, but we had a great time with our three kids and my husband. And we were there three solid weeks. And that was long and hot, hottest place I've ever been in the summer. But it was beautiful and it was fun. We had a free place to stay every night, so that was good. Anything else? Any details? Yeah, tell me a little more. Oh, what did we do? We went on all the rides. This was a while ago, so they didn't have as many. Luckily, we were there when they had... They didn't have the ticket lines, the lines where you could all run in ahead. And I was glad because a little bit old-fashioned about Disney back 25 years ago. It's a big difference. Big, big difference. And we had fun. Ate well. Stayed at grandparents' houses where they took care of us. Had fun. Nice. Thank you.

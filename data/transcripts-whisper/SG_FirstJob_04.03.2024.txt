 One more thing is I'd like you to tell me a little bit about your first or like an initial job that you had in the past. My first job that I can recall, it was in accounting. It was at Union Tools. I worked as a staff accountant. And after working there for a few years, I got promoted and became the accounting supervisor. And after they closed up, I went on to Red Coat and became an accountant there. And they ended up closing and there was five of us left. And we all walked out together. And I was like, hey, let's go.

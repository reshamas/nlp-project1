 Okay, the date is May 1st, 2024, and I'm just going to ask you to tell me a little bit about a trip that you've taken in the past. Oh, I just went to Myrtle Beach. I bought a condo down there, so I went down to, had some problems with it, so I went down to observe it, see how the work was coming in it. Had a little free time away from all the people at home. It was cold. It wasn't only two good days, that was it. So it was a nice trip. My husband's sister, her husband was there, so we had a nice time. Anything else? Can you tell me a little more? Visited our nephew who lives down there. Went out to eat. Didn't get on the beach at all. Because it was not warm enough. That's about all we did. Okay, that's fair.

 I want you to tell me about any kind of trip that you've taken. I know you've traveled a lot. So tell me a little bit about, you know, a trip that you enjoyed. Well, we went to Italy. I enjoyed Italy, enjoyed the food. I enjoyed the wine, and the women are fantastic. It's not the safest place in the world, but you kind of live with it. You kind of, you live with it. You know you're supposed to lock your house and close your windows and all that stuff. But everything was fine. Did you live there or vacation? No, I lived there. Wow. Stayed there for about three years. What part? Naples. Naples. Lovely place. But, like I said, it's not the safest place to live. But. Did you speak Italian? I spoke a little bit, yeah. Wow. A little bit. And did you work there or no? Yes, I did. I worked at a gym. Cool. And what'd your wife do? Because you mentioned it was her job, right? Oh, she, yeah. She was, she ran a tourist place, you know, where people want to take a trip. She had a lot of people that worked for her, but people want to take a trip or whatever, then she set it up. How neat. Yeah. Good.

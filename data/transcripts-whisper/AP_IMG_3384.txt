 I have just one more thing to ask you about. I'm asking people to tell me about a memory from their past, like a childhood memory or when you were young that was like a bad memory. Hopefully nothing too, you know, too traumatic, but you have a memory of something that happened? Yeah, those are when I was six years old. There was a civil war in the Dominican Republic and I remember walking with my father and my father was one of the targets that they had selected to eliminate because he was part of the government that overthrew the communist government that was elected. So I remember the bullets flying over our heads. Oh my goodness. Well that's a terrible memory. Oh my goodness. Yes. But I know from our history that he lived until well into his 90s so... Oh yes. So you may know. That's scary. Did that last for a long time or was it brief? It was from April to about November because the American troops intervened to get everything you know in order. Oh wow. But then in 1966 there was regular elections. But yeah, the American presence was was visible. MS. Mm-hmm. Oh, my goodness, what a memory.

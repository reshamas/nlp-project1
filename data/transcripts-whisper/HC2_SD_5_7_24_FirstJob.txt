 One more thing I'm going to ask you about is to tell me about your first job, or if it's not your very first, one of your first jobs that you've had. Tell me a little bit about that. Oh my God. My first job was at a place called The Beam on Welsh Bush Road. I was 16. Holy crap, that's a long time ago. And it was a burger place. And it was a lot of fun. We had a lot of nice people there. We had fun. That's all. Anything more about it? I told you I'm not a talker. I know. Okay.

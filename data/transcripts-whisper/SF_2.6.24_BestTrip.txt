 Okay, this is SF and the date is 2-6-24. And I would just like you to tell me about a vacation or trip you've taken in your lifetime. It can be any trip when you were younger, older, whatever. My most recent trip, I went to South Carolina to visit my brother who resides there part-time. And I went down there with my daughter, son-in-law, and some other family members. And it was enjoyable because it was the first time I ever been to the beach, the real beach. So it was a fun time. And I don't leave New York State that often. So it was at his condo. They had a pool there. And water is good for me. I have artificial knee pain. I have a knee pain. So I got to spend time in the ocean and also in the pool that they had, their heated pool. So for the week that I was there, it was very enjoyable to spend time with family and also to rehab my knee quite often the time I was there. So that was my most recent trip. And it was enjoyable for two reasons. Oh, good. Okay.

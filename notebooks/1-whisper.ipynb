Two thousand miles away from home. Where we are now. It's good to be in touch with their family and get to do things and to hear their accents and to eat lots of food and just have a good time. Nice. What part of Texas is it? West Texas. Yeah. Hardly rains. Oh wow. One of the things about that place is when I take a walk I don't hardly sweat and that's unusual for me. Yeah. It's also a little bit of a It's just so dry. It's so dry. You listen to the news and humidity today 20% or something like that. And so, it's a real dry place. They grow.

And I had to go to the hospital and get set and stuff like that. That was a long time ago. I don't even, I can't tell you the year either. That's one of the things I do remember most. Oh, poor kid.

Yeah, next door was this big tree and we kids thought it would be cool to climb up in the tree and we had a board and I don't know if we made like a little sign on it or not, but we climbed, we skimmed it up the tree and pounded that board into that tree. And so around the corner was a funeral home and the man, the director of the home was called Van Dusen, Mr. Van Dusen. And so all us kids were, you know, we had those, we had those, this board in the tree and so um um um, so, so somebody said, Van Dusen said to get that bar, that board out of that tree, you know, so I climbed up, yanked the bar, yanked the thing down and threw it down and I jumped out of the thing and I ran on the board with the nails up and I'm walking around screaming and, and, and I'm walking with the board in my, walking with it stuck in my, my, my, my, my, my sneaker, you know, blood all over the place and I'm screaming bloody, bloody murder. My, my, my mom comes running out and stuff like that and, and I'm yelling out, I hate you Van Dusen. And, um, and, and so, you know, obviously we went to the doctor and, and just for like, I don't know, seemed like months, you know, it was hard to even walk, you know, just, you know, trying to re, re, recuperate from it.

It didn't, we just, because it's something you grew up living in and doing and it just, it just didn't bother me. Just, you know, I, I enjoyed, I enjoyed being a kid. I enjoyed growing up the way I did and, you know, I really don't have any. You mentioned you were a football player, so maybe people didn't mess with you. Well, I don't know. But anyway, no, I just.

It was cold. It wasn't only two good days, that was it. So it was a nice trip. My husband's sister, her husband was there, so we had a nice time. Anything else? Can you tell me a little more?

You could see it from the top and it's called the Grand Canyon, Pennsylvania. I have never heard of that. I have to look it up. What part is it near? That I don't remember, but I remember driving to it from Waterloo, New York to the Grand Canyon, Pennsylvania. Did you? Did you stay there for a few days or do some hiking? Just for hiking, yeah. Nice. How long does it take to hike it? As I said, we didn't hike all the way down, but a couple of hours, I would say, yeah. Oh, that is so neat. Yeah. Did you do that recently?

      " We'll talk about one more thing and tell me a little bit about a childhood memory that wasn't good. Hopefully nothing too scary but something you remember from your youth that was a bad memory. When I was around eight or nine years old, I had problems with a kidney that I don't remember too good but all I remember is I was in a hospital when I was around nine years old and I was away from home for over a week which was upsetting. I remember the good part of that was all my aunts and uncles came to visit me in a hospital but I missed my brothers quite a bit and my parents. Hospitals were a lot different back then. It was sort of a colder feeling. I remember that. I was left there alone overnight in a child's ward and the only thing I remember is I talked to my brothers by phone a few times during the week I was there and it seemed so distant even though they were only not even a few blocks away really. It was called St. Luke's Hospital and we lived in East Utica. My dad worked so he only could come see me at night. My mom had to take care of my brothers so she would come see me when she can. I was alone in the hospital at a young age so it was not a memory that I'm fond of but I do remember. Things are different today. You can do things differently with a kid in a hospital. Somehow you make your work a little easier but back then it was hard. Juggling would work in and other children. I remember that. It was a long feeling to be there that long. That's one memory I have from my childhood.\n",

Oh, I remember when I was very young, well, not very, maybe about 10 years old, my father worked in a summer camp and a few of us kids were horsing around and we were climbing out of a window and I sort of fell and hit my wrist and broke my wrist. Which made the rest of the summer, I was in the beginning of the summer, not too much fun because I had a cast on my wrist for like three quarters of the summer. Oh my goodness. Did your dad, did you get in trouble for it? Yeah, minor, minor trouble. Yikes, let's see. It's okay, that's fine. Alright.\n",

Did you go out and do excursions like off the boat or? Yes. Yeah. We took, on that one, we took a horse-drawn carriage through a town whose name I can't remember and that was pretty cool. We went and saw an old village where the people... In the village, they all dressed up like they would have back when the village was founded. Saw some pretty spectacular views in Canada. Nice.

It can be any trip when you were younger, older, whatever. My most recent trip, I went to South Carolina to visit my brother who resides there part-time. And I went down there with my daughter, son-in-law, and some other family members. And it was enjoyable because it was the first time I ever been to the beach, the real beach. So it was a fun time. And I don't leave New York State that often. So it was at his condo. They had a pool there. And water is good for me. I have artificial knee pain. I have a knee pain. So I got to spend time in the ocean and also in the pool that they had, their heated pool. So for the week that I was there, it was very enjoyable to spend time with family and also to rehab my knee quite often the time I was there. So that was my most recent trip.

I mean, things from Disney that I remember from years ago, new things. It was great. Got a lot of pictures and videos. What do you think the highlight was? What was your favorite experience? The Hollywood Tower of Terror, I think they call it. Have you been? Hollywood Tower of Terror. They put you on a ride and you go and you're in this big haunted mansion and you can't see a thing really until you know what's coming up because you could see this tower, this elevator tower open really high and then you hear people screaming, because then it drops you to the bottom.

There was a civil war in the Dominican Republic and I remember walking with my father and my father was one of the targets that they had selected to eliminate because he was part of the government that overthrew the communist government that was elected. So I remember the bullets flying over our heads. Oh my goodness. Well that's a terrible memory. Oh my goodness. Yes. But I know from our history that he lived until well into his 90s so... Oh yes. So you may know. That's scary. Did that last for a long time or was it brief? It was from April to about November because the American troops intervened to get everything you know in order. Oh wow. But then in 1966 there was regular elections. But yeah, the American presence was was visible. MS. Mm-hmm. Oh, my goodness, what a memory.\n",

I brought my kids down there, the whole family down there, stuff like that. Do you stay on the water? Yeah. We have a timeshare. Oh. Okay, so we use the timeshare. We stay on the beach most of the time, travel around to eat, and the place has places where you can use a barbecue grill and stuff like that. They have it out there, either propane or charcoal. Mm-hmm. They have both. And pools and hot tubs and everything else. I don't do the hot tub. I don't like that stuff. Okay. But anyway. Nice. I do the pool and I'll go out, but the ocean's kind of cool. Mm-hmm. It's still cool. Other than that, kids have a ball because it's a sandy beach and stuff like that. It's fun. It's a good time. Yeah, it is fun. Nice. We usually stay a week. Do you get some golfing? Not usually. Not if kids come. Mm-hmm. We don't do that. Because we got one vehicle. Oh, I see. I've been using the company van. Mm-hmm. That's been my car while I'm working. But if I'm done at the end of the year, I really don't know yet to see what the owner has to say. So if he wants me to still come around or not. Mm-hmm. Because he's paying me something, obviously. But I'm still a director. Right. That's why he's hanging on to me just like my, I'll call it my co-partner. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Massachusetts. Let's see. Okay. When we get together and we actually.\n",

Yeah, tell me a little more. Oh, what did we do? We went on all the rides. This was a while ago, so they didn't have as many. Luckily, we were there when they had... They didn't have the ticket lines, the lines where you could all run in ahead. And I was glad because a little bit old-fashioned about Disney back 25 years ago. It's a big difference.

We rode, of course, rides. We took, we took a, went to the Animal Kingdom and rode the safari, which that was fun. We went up and down on Main Street.

Friday we sat... Or Friday we did a few things and then Saturday we went to the Balloon Festival and on a bus trip, which was the easiest and really the cheapest way of getting here because for $25 you took the bus from a shopping mall. And the price of... $25? $25, yeah. The price of getting in and the bus ride was $25. Oh, nice. So it was really reasonable. And the bus dropped us right off at the place we entered the Balloon Festival, which was better than walking a half of a mile from the parking lot. Oh, yeah. Which also included a handicap, which was a half a mile away too. But we did that. Oh, yeah. So that's what we did. That's what we did. That's what we did. We did that for several hours. Came back and rested. We went up to Santa Fe. It was Monday. Yeah. Monday we went to Santa Fe. And we went to... Checked out... Yeah. We went to the oldest house in the United States and the oldest church in the United States. Oh, my goodness. We were going to eat up there, but they also were having a festival at that day, which the center where we wanted to eat was all filled out and there was no place to park. Okay. All right.\n",
